# Evaluation Metrics

## Regression Metrics (Length of Stay)

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - Square root of the average squared differences
* R² Score - Proportion of variance explained by the model

## Classification Metrics (Readmission)

* Accuracy - Overall correctness of the model
* Precision - Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct
* Recall - Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly
* F1 Score - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
* Area Under ROC Curve - Model's ability to distinguish between classes

## Feature Importance

We will analyze feature importance using:

* Permutation importance
* SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
* Partial dependence plots
